PathEdit
========

About
-----

PathEdit is a small program designed to replace the builtin Windows enviroment variable
editor, which can be sumarized as a way-too-hard-to-get-to-and-use-wiith-it-
dinky-one-line-excuse-for-an-editor. Microsoft gives you a 40 characters to edit super long
path names.  Shouldn't this have been written a long time ago?  Hopefully this utility makes
you more productive.
